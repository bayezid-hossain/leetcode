# Code Explanation
# The code provided aims to compute a modified integer ans based on the bit values of two integers, n and x. Here's a breakdown of the code:


# Initialization:


# X is set to x, and N is set to n - 1. These are local copies of the inputs, allowing manipulation without altering the original values.
# ans is initialized to 0, and it will store the result.
# j is initialized to 0 and will track the current bit position in N.
# Loop Through Bits:


# The loop iterates through the first 56 bits (as specified by range(56)). The 56-bit limit matches the assumption that this solution is derived from a 64-bit context, often seen in languages like C++.
# For each bit position i in the 56-bit range:
# Check if the i-th bit of X is set:
# If so, the i-th bit in ans is set to 1, replicating that bit from X.
# If the i-th bit in X is not set:
# The algorithm checks if the j-th bit in N is set.
# If the j-th bit in N is set, it sets the i-th bit in ans to 1, effectively copying bits from N when X[i] is 0.
# The index j increments only when the i-th bit of X is 0, ensuring sequential usage of bits from N only when necessary.
# Return the Result:


# After the loop completes, ans holds the desired integer based on the transformation rules from X and N, and it is returned as the final result.
# Time Complexity
# The loop iterates a fixed 56 times, regardless of the values of n and x.
# Each iteration consists of constant-time bitwise operations (shifts, AND, OR).
# Thus, the time complexity is O(1), since the number of operations does not depend on the input values but is constant at 56 operations.


# Space Complexity
# The space complexity is also O(1), as only a fixed number of integer variables (X, N, ans, j) are used.
# No additional data structures or recursive calls are used, so the memory usage remains constant regardless of input size.
